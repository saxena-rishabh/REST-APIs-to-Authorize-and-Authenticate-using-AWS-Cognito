# REST APIs to Authorize and Authenticate using AWS Cognito

- Created 3 APIs for user registration, user account verification and user login using AWS cognito, API Gateway, boto3 and python.

- After successfull login, we retrieve the ID and Access tokens which can be used further in the work flow.

- Also Created the unit test cases with stubber to test the code locally without invoking the AWS services and hence reducing the bill.

- Unit test cases has 100% code coverage

- Deployed the code to AWS using SAM template.
